                <h2>Why should I learn golf? <i class="fa-solid fa-golf-ball-tee"></i></h2>
                <p>Golf is an immensely popular sport played all over the world and is a very social and enjoyable game.
                    The most ideal way to get started is to take lessons and acquire basic skills before playing a
                    course. As you improve, you should consider getting fitted for a set of clubs or if you are on a
                    budget most golf shops sell second hand clubs and bags that people have traded in for a much more
                    affordable price.</p>

                        <br>
                        <li>Golf clubs have club championships where members can compete to be named as the courses best
                            player for that year and have your name permanently displayed next to the previous winners
                            in the clubhouse for everyone to see.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Can be played in different formats. If you are playing as a large group like a stag party

                    <h2>Health Benefits <i class="fa-solid fa-notes-medical"></i></h2>
                    <p>Golf is great for improving your health and especially for your heart. An average course is
                        around 4 miles long and takes around 3 to 4 hours to play 18 holes. If you play a course as
                        little as three times per week, you would get an optimal amount of endurance exercise for your
                        heart. If you carry your clubs you will benefit even more and burn more calories for each round
                        you play. Golf is also a great mechanism to help you de-stress as you pass through a quiet, wide
                        open and natural environment.</p>

                <h2>Things to be aware of <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i></h2>
                <p>Golf is a relaxing sport and the overall risk of injury is low. However, injuries can still occur.
                    The most common injuries are to the wrist/forearm, lower back and neck. Causes of these injuries
                    include overuse, improper swing form, hitting the ground instead of the ball, and intensifying a
                    previous injury. You can prevent injuries by properly warming up and stretching your back, shoulders
                    and arms before playing followed by a couple of swings using short irons. Lessons also help as good
                    form will massively reduce risk of injury. <a href="signup.html">Find out more</a></p>
