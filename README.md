## Credit

Alot of my code was inspired by the love running project such as the drop down menu. Other than that the rest is my own creation. 
The pictures and videos used on the gallery and sign-up page were provided and permitted by a professional golfer i know personally called Chris Maclean. I also used some free pictures from www.pexels.com in the Home and Careers page.
I used golfcare.co.uk to fact check what I was writing on the careers page so I could be confident I wasn't providing incorrect information. I also used some terminology and links from this site.
