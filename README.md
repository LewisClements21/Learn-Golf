# LEARN GOLF

"Learn Golf" is a website with the aim of helping people increase their skills by providing information via quotes and videos from golf professionals whatever the users current ability be it just starting out or looking to improve their form. The site also provides troubleshooting for common mistakes people make in their swing by helping the user identify the problem and then showing them how to fix it. 

## Features

The website will have a landing page when first opened where there will be a nav bar which contains "Home", "Online Tutorials", "Sign Up"
The Home page will have eye catching visuals to keep the user interested an a background in relation to the content.
I may also add a nav bar for just the home page so people can navigate to what they want to see quicker such as if I add a beginner section and an intermediate section the buttons will take you to the respective section.

The online tutorial page will have videos the user can use to improve their form and learn from professional golfers.

The Sign Up page will allow the user to sign up for online lessons with a professional golfer.

Alot of my code was inspired by the love running project such as the drop down menu. Other than that the rest is from my own mind.
The pictures and videos used on the site were provided by a professional golfer i know personally called Chris Maclean.
