# LEARN GOLF

"Learn Golf" is a website with the aim to convince people to take up golf. 

## Features

The website will have a landing page when first opened where there will be a nav bar which contains "Home", "Benefits", "Golf Careers", "Golf Lessons".
The Home page will have eye catching visuals to keep the user interested and a background in relation to the content (most likely a course in scotland). The home page will have a section telling you what golf is and why so many people love it. there will be a "click here to find out more" which will take the user to the benefits page which will detail all the best things about golf and what makes it different from other sports.
I may also add a "careers" page which will inform people how they can make money while playing golf such as becoming professional and what it takes to become a professional. It will also mention how you could also be a golf instructor, a rewarding career shaping people into golf professionals from a very young age.
When on the benefits page I will reuse the "click here to find out more" after mentioning you could move on from amateur level to professional and play all over the world. Then do the same on the home page and careers page which will take the user to the Lessons page where they can enter their details to be contacted by a Professional PGA golf instructor.
