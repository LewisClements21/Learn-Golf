                <h1>Careers in Golf</h1>
                <br>
                <p>To give you an idea of how lucrative golf can be, there are reports that exempt PGA Tour players earn
                    a base income of $500,000 per year and the average income for professional golfers is around $2m per
                    year. Tiger Woods has the highest career earnings on the PGA Tour at $120,954,766.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are alot of different careers and opportunities within golf that can take you all around the
                    world and make a lot of money in the process!. These are some examples:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Professional Golfer</li>
                    <li>Golf Professional</li>
                    <li>Caddy</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>For now we will focus on careers playing golf. However, there are a lot more jobs in the golf
                    industry but you don't get the chance to play in these professions. Some examples of these are:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Club Fitter (A lot of professionals who have their own golf shop offer this service)</li>
                    <li>Greenkeeper</li>
                    <li>Golf Rules official</li>
                    <li>Golf cart attendant (This is more common in warmer climates)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>First you should decide which field you would like to work in. As mentioned there is a lot to choose
                    from, It is accepted that golf professionals work in the business or management side of golf or
                    teach amateur and/or professional golfers. Then you have professional golfers who play high profile
                    tournaments like the PGA Tour and the Masters.
                    <br>
                    A lot of professional golfers follow the route of becoming a golf professional beforehand, as they
                    have are heavily involved with their home club growing up. However, most start as amateur golfers
                    and rely on their talent to get noticed. Do not think your too old to become professional, there
                    have been many late comers before. It is only a matter of perseverance and skill above all else.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>How do I become a Professional Golfer?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The best way to start is by getting in touch with our professional golf instructor Chris Maclean 
                    <a href="signup.html">here.</a> With Chris's guidance, you can establish a training programme
                    tailored to perfecting your technique and improve your ability faster than working alone. Golf is
                    extremely competitive, especially since so many golfers start young. But with proper tuition and the
                    right mind-set to consistently work on every part of your game no matter how frustrating, you will
                    easily surpass those who will give up too easily.
                </p>
                <p>When you have achieved a standard where you are consistantly hitting great shots, prove your skill in
                    some friendly competitions at your local golf club, then progress to more formal events.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>How do I find golf events?</h3>
                <p>Using the <a href="https://www.golfempire.co.uk/">Golf Empire Tool</a> you can browse more than
                    10,000 amateur open tournaments at over 1500 clubs in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>You can enter as many events as you wish meaning you can find out what is expected at these events
                    without committing to the full thing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Becoming a Pro</h2>
                <br>
                <p>When you reach the point where you are consistently dominating amateur competitions and you feel
                    confident enough to take your career further. Golf differs from other sports where you would be
                    signed up to a team, YOU decide whether or not you feel ready to go pro.
                </p>
                <p>Before registering for professional events, you should be at the best level you can be as they are
                    very expensive to enter and highly competitive. In the UK, the easiest way into professional events
                    is by becoming a PGA member and entering the PGA Open series, which entails £100 registration fee
                    and a £20,000 prize fund. This is a huge leap of faith as it doesn't always work out for everyone so
                    make sure you have funding behind you from sponsorships and family etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Earning your PGA Tour Card</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Finishing in the top 25 in the Korn Ferry Tour which sits just below the PGA tour and is a definitive way
                    to earn a PGA Tour card, but you can only enter this tour if you go to Qualifying-school beforehand.
                    This involves competing over four months to place in one of the top 25 which earns you an
                    unconditional place on the Korn Ferry Tour but you can still get a conditional place if you finish
                    26-50. However, If you play well enough to finish in the top five of final stage Qualifying-school,
                    you can get your PGA Tour card this way rather than competing in the Korn Ferry Tour. When you get
                    your PGA card you now have the opportunity to compete against the most elite players in the world.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>You are now living out your wildest dreams</h2>
                <br>
                <p>You have become 1 of 125 people holding a PGA Tour card and you should remain at the top of your game
                    and do everything possible to keep your spot as one of the best players in the world. You may
                    never make it back if you let your game slip. Avoid injuries, maintain your confidence, and never
                    underestimate the importance of practice. Winning competitions such as the Players Championship or
                    The Masters solidifies your status as a top-class golfer and will guarantee your spot on the PGA
                    Tour for years at a time. For example, if you win the Players Championship you will receive a five-year
                    exemption, a three-year invite to the Masters, and a three-year exemption for the Open and the PGA
                    Championship.</p>
